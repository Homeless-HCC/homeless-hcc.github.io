    <h2>About Homeless</h2>
    <p>Supporting homeless initiatives and community outreach programs.</p>
    <p>
      Homeless Coin was born from a simple, painful reality: too many people fall through the cracks, 
      and the world moves on like nothing happened. This coin exists to make sure those people are never 
      ignored again. Every Homeless Coin carries the weight of someone's cold night, someone's empty stomach, 
      someone's quiet prayer that tomorrow might hurt less than today. It carries the story of the veteran 
      sleeping under a bridge, the single parent holding a child close to stay warm, the teenager pretending 
      they're "just out walking" because admitting they have no place to go is too heavy to say out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      This token fights for them. Homeless Coin is a promise that someone out there still cares. It turns 
      compassion into fuel, and fuel into real help: blankets, shelter, food, protection, a moment of peace 
      in a life that hasn't had any in too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Homeless Coin isn't about crypto. It's about humanity. We plan to allocate funds to headquarters, 
      mobile food trucks, emergency aid, and local programs.
